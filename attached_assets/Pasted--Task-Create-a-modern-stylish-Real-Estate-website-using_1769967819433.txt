**Task:** Create a modern, stylish **Real Estate website** using **React** (no backend or database, just static files). The site should be designed to **convert visitors into leads** and have a **corporate yet luxury** look and feel. It must be a standalone static site (e.g., using Create React App or similar), deployable on Vercel. Include all typical pages and features of a high-end real estate website.

**Pages & Routes:**
1. **Home Page (`/`):** 
   - A hero section with a full-width image of a luxury property and an overlay text (e.g., “Find Your Dream Home” or “Luxury Properties Just For You”). 
   - A prominent Call-To-Action button (e.g., “Browse Listings” or “Contact Us”) that directs users to the Listings or Contact page.
   - Brief introductory text or tagline about the company (e.g., “Leading real estate agency in [Area] providing premium residential and commercial properties.”).
   - Optionally, showcase 2-3 *featured listings* in a highlighted section (each with an image, price, address) with a button/link to view more details (or to go to the Listings page).

2. **Listings Page (`/listings`):** 
   - Displays a **grid of property listing cards** for **Residential and Commercial** properties (mix of both). Use **mock data** to populate these listings (hardcode an array of listing objects in the code).
   - Each **Listing Card** should show: a property image, name or title, location (city/area), price, and property type (Residential or Commercial). You can also include a couple of icons or text for key details (e.g., “3 Bed, 2 Bath, 2500 sqft” for residential, or “Office Space, 5000 sqft” for commercial).
   - Include a **Filter Bar** above the listings to filter by:
     - **Price Range** (Min and Max price inputs or a slider).
     - **Location** (dropdown or text input for city/neighborhood).
     - **Property Type** (checkbox or toggle for Residential, Commercial).
   - Implement filtering in React: when the user adjusts filters, update state and filter the list of listings to only show matching properties.
   - Ensure the layout is responsive (e.g., 3-column grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile). Cards should be uniformly styled (perhaps with a slight hover effect and a shadow or border).
   - (No pagination needed – assume a manageable number of listings in mock data).

3. **About Page (`/about`):** 
   - Describe the real estate company or agent. Include an **about section** with a photo (e.g., of the team or a luxury property) and text describing the company’s history, mission, and what makes it unique.
   - Emphasize experience and trustworthiness (e.g., “25+ years in the luxury real estate market”, “Over $1B in properties sold”, or similar accolades — these can be fictional for the mock).
   - Possibly include a small section for **testimonials or client quotes** for social proof (static text quotes like “Working with [Company] was a pleasure...”). This is optional but adds credibility.
   - Keep the styling consistent: use the same color scheme and fonts, and maybe a subdued background image or color for this page to keep it elegant.

4. **Contact Page (`/contact`):** 
   - A **contact form** for visitors to get in touch. Use input fields for **Name**, **Email**, **Phone** (make this optional), and a larger textarea for **Message**.
   - The form **does not actually submit to a server** (since there's no backend). Instead, implement a mock submission: when the user hits "Send Message", prevent the default behavior and show a success message on the page (e.g., “Thank you for contacting us! We will get back to you soon.”). You can simply use component state to conditionally render this message in place of the form after submission.
   - Also display direct contact info: for example, a phone number and an email address for the agency, and maybe a physical address. This provides alternative ways to contact and adds legitimacy.
   - Optionally, embed a simple Google Map iframe or image of the service area (not required, but common on real sites).
   - Make sure the page is styled nicely: the form should be centered or appropriately spaced, and the submit button should stand out (use the accent color and a hover effect).

**Navigation & Layout:**
- Implement a **navbar** at the top of the site, visible on all pages. It should have the company logo (can just be a text logo like “RealtyCo” for now) and navigation links to Home, Listings, About, Contact.
- The navbar should be responsive: on smaller screens, collapse into a hamburger menu.
- Implement routing so that clicking nav links loads the respective page without refresh (use React Router’s `<BrowserRouter>` and `<Route>` or `<Routes>` for each page).
- Include a **footer** at the bottom of pages with company name, copyright notice, and perhaps some secondary links or info (e.g., “© 2026 RealtyCo. All Rights Reserved.”). Keep the footer design simple and in line with the site’s style (same color scheme).

**Design & Style Requirements:**
- **Theme:** Corporate & Luxury. Use a **clean, elegant design**:
  - Colors: Prefer a neutral/dark background (e.g., white or dark charcoal) with **luxurious accent colors** like gold or deep blue. For example, a white background with navy blue headers and gold highlights, or a dark background with white text and gold buttons. Ensure good contrast for readability.
  - Typography: Use a sleek, professional font. You may use a serif font for headings (to convey luxury) and a sans-serif for body text. All text should be easily readable (decent font sizes, line spacing).
  - Emphasize high-quality images. You can use placeholder images (from a source like Unsplash) for property photos – ensure they look upscale (modern interiors, beautiful houses, commercial buildings). Optimize the images for web so the site remains fast.
  - Layout: Use plenty of whitespace and a **grid system** for alignment. Sections should be clearly separated with consistent margins/padding. Strive for a **“minimalist luxury”** feel – not too much clutter, just impactful images and well-chosen text.
- **Responsiveness:** The site **must be mobile-friendly**. Use CSS media queries or flexible layouts to ensure that on mobile devices the content stacks nicely (e.g., the nav becomes a hamburger, grids become single column, text is still readable without zooming). Test the layout on different screen sizes.
- **Interactions:** Add some subtle interactive touches for a modern feel:
  - For example, on the CTA buttons and nav links, add a hover state change (color or underline). 
  - Maybe animate the opening of the mobile menu, or fade in elements on page load/scroll. Keep animations subtle to maintain a classy look.
- **Conversion Elements:** Include **clear CTAs** on appropriate pages. Examples:
  - A “View Listings” button on the Home hero.
  - A “Schedule a Tour” or “Contact Us” button on a featured listing or alongside property details.
  - The Contact form’s Submit button is a conversion point – make it prominent.
  - If you include any lead-capture offers (like “Subscribe for updates” on the footer), style those consistently too.
- **Consistency:** Ensure the **branding is consistent** across pages (colors, font choices, button styles, image filters, etc.). It should feel like a cohesive website for one company.

**Technical Details:**
- Use **React functional components** and hooks (e.g., useState for form and filter handling, useEffect if needed).
- No external state management library is needed – the app is simple enough to manage with local component state or context.
- For styling, you can use plain CSS (with a CSS file for each component or a global stylesheet) or a CSS-in-JS solution. You can also use a framework like **Tailwind CSS** or Bootstrap if it helps, but ensure the final look matches the described custom style (don’t just use default Bootstrap look; customize it for the luxury feel).
- Prepare the app for deployment: e.g., ensure that routes work with client-side routing on Vercel (if using React Router, you may need a `/*` catch-all in Vercel settings or use HashRouter for simplicity).
- Write clean, well-organized code. Comment sections of the code to explain key parts (especially where data is filtered, or where the form submission is handled) for clarity.
- Assume the user will deploy this on Vercel, so it should be optimized and production-ready (run `npm run build` without errors). No sensitive info or keys needed since there’s no backend.

**Goal:** The end result should be a **fully functional static React website** with a beautiful UI that impresses visitors and encourages them to convert (contact or engage with listings). Focus on great design (per the luxury corporate theme) and usability.

_Start coding the React project following the above specifications. Create all necessary components, add the mock data, and apply styling. Once done, the site should be ready to deploy on Vercel as a static app. Good luck!_
